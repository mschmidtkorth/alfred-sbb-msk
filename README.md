# SBB/CFF/FFS (Swiss Railway) Timetable Workflow
This workflow allows you to show SBB train connections.

# Features
Shows the following information for connections:
- Station names, performs 'best guess' on addresses
- Departure and arrival time
- Duration of travel
- Train types and names
- Number of transfers

Results are sorted from earliest to latest departure.

## Installation & Requirements
For this workflow you need

**Examples**
- From main station to main station:
```text
sbb Zurich Basel
```
This will list trains going from *Zurich main station* to *Basel main station*.

- From one station to another station:
```text
sbb Zurich, Belevue Basel
```
This will list trains going from from *Zurich, Bellevueplatz* to *Basel*. Note that the typo 'Belevue' (instead of 'Bellevue') is automatically corrected and results are returned for *Bellevueplatz*.

The workflow will perform a 'best guess' on the station name, e.g. 'Bannhof' is interpreted as 'Bahnhof', or 'Bellevue' is interpreted as 'ZÃ¼rich, Bellevueplatz'.
